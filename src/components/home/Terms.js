                    certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we
                    receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name,
                    e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make

                    policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the Services or Apps. Please note that we do not
                    control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third party
                    social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they
                    collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
                their sites and apps.</p>


                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-8 text-brand" id="7">7. How long do we keep your information?</h2>

                    <p class="text-lg py-2">In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg py-2">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                    delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
                    has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
                isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-8 text-brand" id="8">8. How do we keep your information safe?</h2>

                    <br />
                    <p class="text-lg py-2">If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your
                account, you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-lg py-2">Log into your account settings and update your user account.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p class="text-lg py-2">Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
                    information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to
                    prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use
                and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg py-2">Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
                    prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you
                    choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our
                Services or Apps.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg py-2">Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by
                    clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details
                    provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list – however, we will still need
                    to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your
                account. To otherwise opt-out, you may:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-lg py-2">Access your account settings and update preferences.</li>

                    <p class="text-lg py-2">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
                    recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
                    DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
                    tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
                will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>
